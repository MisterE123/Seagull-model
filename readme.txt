straight ahead: 340 - 350

transition from soar looking down to flying position 
with wings folded: 370 - 380

flying position with wings folded. 
(this is good for diving, falling, dieing, 
swimming underwater, speeding up while flying, etc): 380 - 390

transition FROM soaring (with head up) TO flying position with wings folded:
400 - 405

transition FROM flying position with wings folded TO soaring (with head up)
:405 - 410

transition FROM neutral flying position TO standing (running, flapping landing):
440 - 480

Note: The above transition can be used for water landings too... the next transition goes from standing to floating...
Land to standing position... transfer to floating position if on water.

transition from standing to floating:500 - 510

Floating (could be sitting): 510 - 520

swimming loop (with head up e.g. not under water):520-540

Transition from flying to attacking: 560-570

Attack loop: 570 - 630

Transition from attack TO fly: 650- 660

NOTE: to get an animation of grabbing, for example grabbing a fish from the water, or bread from a player, or a quick fly-by attack,
simply play the (Transition from flying to attacking: 560-570) followed immediately by (Transition from attack TO fly: 650- 660)
